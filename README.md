### Hey, I'm Will

I write code and occassionally look at IDA for some extended periods of time.

Currently working on various No Man's Sky projects such as [ReNMS](https://github.com/VITALISED/renms).

Inquiries or if you just want to read semi whimsical blog posts can be found [here](https://will.k0.tel).

I'm also available for hire, shoot me an email, it's on my website. :)
